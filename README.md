# Electronic Mouse Trap

This project is designed to provide a simple and effective way to catch mice indoors using an electronic mouse trap. The project utilizes a pair of infrared phototransistor and LED for triggering. The microcontroller used is Atmega328pb. To activate the mouse trap, simply place the bait inside and wait for the mouse to enter.

Features

Utilizes infrared phototransistor and LED for effective bait monitoring.
Uses the Atmega328pb microcontroller for signal processing and control.
Allows for the placement of bait inside the mouse trap for efficient mouse capture.

Materials

Atmega328pb Microcontroller
Infrared Phototransistor and LED
Battery (e.g., LiPo or other suitable type for the project's needs)
Button (for arming the mouse trap)
Buzzer (for signaling mouse capture)
Other necessary components (resistors, wires, boards, etc.)
Connections and Assembly
Connect the components following the schematic, which can be found in the schematics section.
Assemble the physical structure of the mouse trap, taking into consideration the needs for securing components and ensuring user safety.

Software

Download the microcontroller's code from the repository.
Edit configuration parameters as needed (e.g., input-output ports, frequencies, sound signals, etc.).

Usage

Connect the battery and press the "Arming" button.
Place the mouse trap in a potentially frequented area by mice.
Wait for the mouse trap to capture a mouse.
When a mouse is caught, you'll hear a signal from the buzzer.
